        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tempura is a traditional Japanese dish that became popular during the Edo era (1603–1867).
             It's made by coating vegetables or seafood in a thin batter and deep-frying it.
              The word "tempura" comes from the Portuguese word tempero, which means "seasoning".
